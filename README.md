## üîå Skema Koneksi Perangkat
Hubungkan pin STM32F401 ke ENC28J60 sesuai tabel berikut:

| **STM32F401 Pin** | **ENC28J60 Pin** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| GND                | GND             |
| 3.3V               | VCC             |
| PA5 (SPI_SCK)      | SCK             |
| PA6 (SPI_MISO)     | SO              |
| PA7 (SPI_MOSI)     | SI              |
| PA4 (SPI_CS)       | CS              |
| PA8                | RESET           |
| PB2                | INT             |

**Note:**
- Make sure the ENC28J60 uses a 3.3V power supply.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Installation

### 1. **Installing Toolchain**
- Download and install **STM32CubeIDE** from [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com).
- Make sure you have the appropriate STM32 HAL library (FreeRTOS).
  
### 2. **Adding ENC28J60 and LwIP Library**
- The **LwIP & ENC28J60** library is available in this repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è STM32 Project Configuration

### 1. **Setting SPI**
1. Open **STM32CubeMX** and create a new project.
2. Enable **SPI1**:
   - Mode: *Full Duplex Master*
   - Prescaler: Adjust the baud rate to suit your needs.
3. Set SPI pins:
   - PA5: SPI1_SCK
   - PA6: SPI1_MISO
   - PA7: SPI1_MOSI
   - PA4: SPI1_CS
4. Enable clock for GPIO and SPI.
5. Enable pins UART for debuging :
   - PA2 : USART2_TX
   - PA3 : USART2_RX

   
### 2. **Clock Configuration**
- Set the system clock using **HSE/PLL** for high performance.

### ENC28J60 Function Implementation

Use functions from the ENC28J60 library to:

- Module initialization
- Sending data packets via Ethernet

---

### üß™ Testing

1. Connect the ENC28J60 to a router or switch using an Ethernet cable.
2. Run the code on the STM32.
3. Use an application such as **Wireshark** to monitor the data packets sent.
